To run :
python optimal_hyperparameters.py

It will do grid search on the given variations for each hyperparameter.
while doing so it will print to the terminal the validation accuracy and confidence interval for each possible combination.

Lastly it will print the test result by using the test data on the best combination that we found. Mean test accuracy and confidence interval 
will be printed.

To illustrate how learning rate affects the accuracy of the model. It will plot a graph that shows how the accuracy changes for each learning rate.
